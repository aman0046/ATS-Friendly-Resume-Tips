1) **Use Relevant Keywords**: For every job application, include the keyword used in the job description. This will help in getting a better ATS Score.
  
3) **No unnecessary personal details**: In resume we only have to add our name, email, contact number, location and linkedin profile. No need to add your complete address and family details.
4) **Right Section Header**: Use clear and consistent header for each section of your resume (e.g., Experience, Education, skills etc) and avoid creative section header. So that ATS can map that easily.
5) **Must Have Sections**: Education, Experience, Skills, Achievements, and Projects.
6) **Avoid Unnecessary section**: Don’t need to add an objective section and all, your objective and work must be visible in the entire resume rather than mentioning.
7) **Highlight tech stack and important keywords**: Don’t forget to highlight all the tech stack you have used in your internship and projects, So that it will catch recruiter’s attention directly  because recruiter’s have hardly 1 min to go through a resume.
8) **No long blocks of text**: Instead of writing big paragraphs, breaking it into bullet points will improve readability of the resume.
9) **Use more numbers in your resume**: Try to add numbers and metrics, You can use them to quantify your achievements, demonstrate your value, and highlight your skills. To do this, include relevant numbers and metrics in the summary, work experience, education, and skills sections of your resume.
10) **Add Necessary links**: Try to add the live link of your projects, because no one are interested to read the code, also mention all the coding profile links, github link so that one can check your work.
11) **Check Spell and Grammar**: Double check spelling and grammar, because errors in spelling and grammar will reduce your ATS score.
